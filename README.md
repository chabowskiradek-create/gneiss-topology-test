# gneiss-topology-test
**First observational test of spectral asymmetry (η-invariant) in natural magnetospheric plasma.**  This repository contains the analysis pipeline for testing whether black aurora—mysterious dark gaps in Earth's polar lights—exhibit topological signatures predicted by spectral geometry.
